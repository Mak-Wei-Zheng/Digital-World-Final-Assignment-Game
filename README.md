# Digital-World-Final-Assignment-Game
## Two player RPG
Choose between 3 characters: vampire, tank, gambler and battle each other
all characters have 100 health and 100 mana but tank has a stronger health regeneration each round
vampire heals for a percentage of damage dealt while gambler has a 20% chance to do 50% more damage

## game mechanics:
To begin a game, both players roll dices to see who starts first.
Then the game begins,
each round, each player indicates their guesses from 1 to 10. Then a 10-sided dice is rolled.
If your guess is over the number of roll, you don't deal any damage, if not... you deal damage equal to 3 x guess.
each round, players also get to cast offensive spells such as lightning and ignite which incapacitates and damages the opponent respectively.
The debuffs applied by the offensive spells can be removed using heal and extinguish
after the attacks and spell casts, the characters regenerate health and mana based on their character's traits.
The current health and mana is then displayed... players cannot have more than 100 health and mana.
Last man standing wins, in the event where both characters die in the same round, the person who starts wins. :)

## Rules:
the game is simple, just some side points about gameplay.
invalid input formats such as putting a letter when a number is asked for will request for another input
invalid numbers out of the range from 1 to 10 will default the guess to 1...
invalid spell inputs default to "N" indicating no spell cast
